# Tea Leaf Classification Project

## Overview

This project focuses on the classification of tea leaves into different grades using the YOLOv8 object detection model. The classification is based on various factors such as stem length, presence of buds, and other relevant features. The tea grades are categorized into Grade A, Grade B, and Grade C.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of images of tea leaves with corresponding annotations. The annotations include information about the grade of the tea leaves, such as the presence of buds, stem length, and other relevant attributes.

## YOLOv8 Model

The YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) model is employed for object detection and classification tasks. YOLOv8 is known for its speed and accuracy, making it suitable for real-time applications. The model is trained on the annotated tea leaf dataset to classify tea leaves into Grade A, Grade B, and Grade C.

## Tea Grades Criteria

The classification into Grade A, Grade B, and Grade C is based on the following criteria:

- **Stem Length:** The length of the stem is a crucial factor in determining the grade of the tea leaf.
- **Presence of Buds:** The presence or absence of buds contributes to the overall quality and grade of the tea.

## Training

To train the YOLOv8 model, follow these steps:

1. **Data Preparation:** Organize your dataset with annotated images and corresponding labels.
2. **Configuration:** Adjust the YOLOv8 configuration file to suit the requirements of the tea leaf classification task.
3. **Training:** Train the model using the YOLOv8 training script, specifying the appropriate parameters.

## Usage

To use the trained model for tea leaf classification:

1. **Model Inference:** Run the YOLOv8 inference script on new images of tea leaves.
2. **Results:** Review the classification results, including the predicted grade and relevant attributes.
